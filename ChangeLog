----------, Version 0.0.7

* Dropped support for CouchDB < 1.1

* Renamed timestamp field to createdTime - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE - please
  make sure you change all references to fields.timestamp in your apps to
  fields.createdTime.

* Changes to db module:

  * Some db module functions now expect a JSON mime-type as the response and
    return an error if another type is used

  * Added deleteUser method to db module

  * Added getReplication, stopReplication, waitReplication, and startReplication
    functions to db module. These functions are designed to work with the
    _replicator database in CouchDB 1.1

  * Added getList, getShow and getRewrite functions to db module

    removeDoc

* Changes to utils module:

  * Added redirect method to utils

  * setPropertyPath and getPropertyPath in utils now accept strings as well as
    arrays

  * Added isSubPath to utils module


* Added a testsuite app so kanso's commonjs module tests will run in the browser

* Big Forms and widgets rewrite to make complex embedded fields more portable
  and flexible - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE - custom widgets and form
  renderers will need to be updated to use the new API
   
  * Update form.validate to also run permissions checks

  * Add ability to exclude fields from a form when initialized using a Type
    definition

* Removed History.js dependency and integrated HTML5 history handling using
  pushState only - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE - older browsers will see
  some degradtion in performance

  (previously Kanso was repeating unsafe requests such as POST, PUT and DELETE
  without warning)

  and sessionChange events are bound. Create a new project skeleton for
  example usage.

    and afterResponse events

  API documentation

* Fixed a few small bugs in Admin app

* Assume http://127.0.0.1:5984 if host and port are not specified when using
  command-line tool. Than means you can push to 'dbname' by doing:
  "kanso push dbname" instead of "kanso push http://127.0.0.1:5984/dbname"

* Added short-hand response style, allowing you to return
  {title: '...', content: '...'} from a list, show or update function and
  kanso will do the right thing depending on whether its running client-side
  or server-side. See the new tutorial for example usage.

* Obey redirects returned from list, show and update functions, see new
  tutorial for example usage

* Automatically save documents returned from update function when run in the
  browser, see new tutorial for example usage

* Made it easier to share code between the normal app modules and CouchDB
  views, see new guide on sharing code with views for more info

  filesystem before importing, allowing you to convert from .csv to .json and
  add or clear CouchDB _id properties to documents. See the new "working with
  data" guide for more info

  handling large files
